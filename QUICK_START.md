- ✅ Dashboard with sample data
- ✅ Properties listing (4 sample properties)
- ✅ Market insights view
- ✅ All navigation working
- ⚠️ API calls won't work (need backend)
- ⚠️ No data persistence

This is perfect for:
- Portfolio showcase
- Demonstration purposes
- UI/UX review
- Design presentation

## 🔌 To Make It Fully Functional

You need to deploy the backend separately. Here's the easiest option:

### Deploy Backend to Render.com (FREE)

1. **Go to** https://render.com and sign up

2. **Create New Web Service**
   - Click "New +" → "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select `rust-realestate-dashboard` repo

3. **Configure Service**
   - **Name**: `realestate-backend`
   - **Region**: Choose nearest to you
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Root Directory**: `backend`
   - **Runtime**: `Rust`
   - **Build Command**: `cargo build --release`
   - **Start Command**: `./target/release/realestate-backend`

4. **Add Environment Variables**
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:./data/realestate.db
   HOST=0.0.0.0
   PORT=3000
   CORS_ORIGIN=https://sauceslinger.github.io
   RUST_LOG=info
   ```

5. **Create Service** (first deploy takes ~5-10 minutes)

6. **Copy Your Backend URL**
   - Example: `https://realestate-backend-xxxx.onrender.com`

7. **Update Frontend Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Edit frontend/.env.production
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://realestate-backend-xxxx.onrender.com/api
   ```

8. **Commit and Push**
   ```bash
   git add frontend/.env.production
   git commit -m "Configure production API endpoint"
   git push origin main
   ```

9. **Wait for GitHub Actions to redeploy** (~2 minutes)

10. **Visit your site** - Now fully functional! 🎉

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

### "404 - Page Not Found"
- Wait a few more minutes for deployment
- Check Actions tab for any errors
