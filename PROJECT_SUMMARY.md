```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

#### Backend
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
mkdir -p data
cargo install sqlx-cli --no-default-features --features sqlite
sqlx database create
sqlx migrate run
cargo run
```

#### Frontend

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Docker

## 📊 Database Schema

The SQLite database includes:
- **properties** - Property listings and details
- **tenants** - Tenant information and leases
- **calendar_events** - Events, reminders, and schedules
- **maintenance_records** - Maintenance tracking
- **market_data** - Scraped market insights

Sample data is included for testing!

## 🌐 API Endpoints

All endpoints are documented in `DEVELOPMENT.md` and include:
- Full CRUD for properties, tenants, events, and maintenance
- Market data analytics
- Trend visualization data
- Data scraping triggers

## 🎨 Frontend Features

- **Dashboard**: Overview of portfolio with key metrics
- **Properties**: Grid view of all properties with status indicators
- **Property Detail**: Individual property information
- **Tenants**: Tenant management (ready for implementation)
- **Calendar**: Event scheduling (ready for implementation)
- **Maintenance**: Work order tracking (ready for implementation)
- **Market Insights**: Analytics and trend visualization

## 📝 Configuration Files

- `backend/.env` - Backend configuration
- `frontend/.env` - Frontend configuration (optional)
- `docker-compose.yml` - Container orchestration
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD automation

## 🔧 Development Tools

- Rust Analyzer for Rust development
- Volar for Vue development
- ESLint for code quality
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- Docker extension support

## 📖 Documentation

- `README.md` - Project overview and setup instructions
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Detailed development guide
- API documentation in code comments
- TypeScript types for type safety

## ✨ Features Ready to Implement

The framework is ready for you to:
1. Enhance the scraper with real data sources
2. Add authentication and authorization
3. Implement file uploads for property images
4. Add more detailed analytics and charts
5. Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
6. Add email notifications for events
7. Expand tenant and lease management
8. Add financial reporting features

## 🎯 Live Editing Capabilities

The project includes:
- Hot module replacement in frontend (Vite)
- Cargo watch support for backend (install with `cargo install cargo-watch`)
- Docker volume mounting for development
- Proxy configuration for seamless API integration

## 📌 Important Notes

1. The TypeScript/CSS errors you see are expected until dependencies are installed
2. Run `npm install` in the frontend directory to resolve them
3. The scraper currently uses mock data - implement real scrapers as needed
4. Database is SQLite for simplicity - can be migrated to PostgreSQL if needed
5. GitHub Actions workflows require repository secrets for deployment

## 🤝 Ready for Contribution

The project follows best practices:
- Modular architecture
- Type safety
- Error handling
- Clean code structure
- Documentation
- Automated testing setup
- CI/CD pipelines

## 🎊 You're All Set!

Your real estate dashboard framework is complete and ready for development. Start the servers and begin building your features!

Happy coding! 🚀
